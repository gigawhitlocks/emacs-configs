#+TITLE: Configuration for MY DESKTOP

I didn't bother to build Emacs from source on this machine because it's Arch, by the way, and it comes with 29.4 (at time of writing) but I might do that later if I discover this has build flags I don't like, lol. Because I'm that kind of person now I guess.

Anyway I also just installed stuff from the repos to make this work, first the fonts are needed and my install script doesn't work because it's only for Ubuntu

#+begin_example bash
  sudo pacman -S woff2-fira-code
#+end_example

and I discovered that there is no ~hostname~ command in Arch by default, I guess? So I just created one real quick
#+begin_example bash :tangle /sudo::/usr/local/bin/hostname :chmod 0755 :shebang /bin/bash
  cat /etc/hostname
#+end_example

* Footer
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (provide 'local)
#+END_SRC
