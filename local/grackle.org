#+TITLE: Configuration for MY DESKTOP
* Emacs Configuration
I didn't bother to build Emacs from source on this machine because it's Arch, by the way, and it comes with 29.4 (at time of writing) but I might do that later if I discover this has build flags I don't like, lol. Because I'm that kind of person now I guess.

I did need to install this package, though, so I'm noting it here for future reference:

#+begin_example bash
  sudo pacman -S woff2-fira-code
#+end_example

I also later discovered that I really needed the ~emacs-wayland~ package to work nicely in Arch and avoid strange bugs.


* Theme

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  (load-theme 'doom-nord-light)
#+end_src

** Footer
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (provide 'local)
#+END_SRC
