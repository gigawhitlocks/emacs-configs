* Prologue
This is my Emacs configuration. It is written in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] format, which means that I can display a static representation here, but the [[https://github.com/gigawhitlocks/emacs-configs][source repository]] and document ([[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigawhitlocks/emacs-configs/refs/heads/master/readme.org][plain text view]]), are interactive when opened in Emacs.

It follows the concept of "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]]" and both defines my Emacs configuration (as well as a few other, related things) and includes my notes about why I made those changes, and what I was doing at the time, as well as whatever other commentary I felt like including at the time (related or otherwise).

At least, that's the goal. In reality, it's a messy living document that I use to configure Emacs and to keep track of what I've done. I don't always take the best of notes, but it is sufficient for me to keep moving forward. If you search around, you may find ideas and code that you can repurpose for your own uses.

* Entrypoint
The source code in this file is extracted to ~init.el~ by calling ~M-x org-babel-tangle~.

** Customize
Emacs provides a menu-based customization interface that makes configuration files like this one entirely optional, and sometimes Emacs prompts the user for things and saves their preferences to a "custom file." By default, that file is /this/ file, but the auto-generated code is nasty, disposable, and almost always specific to the system where I've made some interactive choice -- for instance to trust local variables set in the header of a file like this one -- and after a long time I've realized it's too troublesome to check in those changes. So this setting tells Customize to write those settings to their own file, and this file is ignored in ~.gitignore~.

This variable is set before everything in the config because ~readme.org~ references it at the top of the file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/.emacs-custom.el")
  (load custom-file)
#+END_SRC

** Extract Org Files and Load Them
I'm using an [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-emacs-init][example from orgmode.org]] to load the Org files and tangle them, then ~require~ the output of this file from the call to tangle, run ~main~, and I'm done.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq dotfiles-dir
        (file-name-directory
         (or (buffer-file-name) load-file-name)))

  (let* ((org-dir (expand-file-name
                   "lisp" (expand-file-name
                           "org" (expand-file-name
                                  "src" dotfiles-dir))))
         (org-contrib-dir (expand-file-name
                           "lisp" (expand-file-name
                                   "contrib" (expand-file-name
                                              ".." org-dir))))
         (load-path (append (list org-dir org-contrib-dir)
                            (or load-path nil))))
    ;; load up Org-mode and Org-babel
    (require 'ob-tangle))

  ;; load up all literate org-mode files in this directory
  (mapc #'org-babel-load-file (directory-files dotfiles-dir t "\\.org$"))
#+END_SRC

* Package Manager Bootstrap
After tangling the source files and loading ~init.el~, the first thing that must be done is to prepare to manage third party packages, because my config is built on top of the work of many third party packages. I like to install and manage all of the packages I use as part of my configuration so that it can be duplicated across computers (more or less) and managed with ~git~, so I use ~use-package~ to ensure that packages are installed from my configuration file.

Bootstrap sets up the ELPA, Melpa, and Org Mode repositories, sets up the package manager, configures ~use-package~ and installs a few extra packages that acoutrement ~use-package~ and will be used heavily throughout. It used to install ~use-package~ itself, however, it has since been upstreamed and that step has been removed. 🎉

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                           ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                           ("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/")))
  (package-initialize)

  ;; set ensure to be the default
  (require 'use-package-ensure)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)

  ;; these go in bootstrap because packages installed
  ;; with use-package use :diminish and :delight
  (use-package diminish)
  (use-package delight)
#+END_SRC

Once this is done I need to install and configure any third party packages that are used in many modes throughout Emacs. Some of these modes fundamentally change the Emacs experience and need to be present before everything can be configured.
* Fundamental Package Installation and Configuration
First I need to install packages with a large effect and on which other packages are likely to depend. These are packages essential to my workflow. Configuration here should be config that must run early, before variables are set or language-related packages, which will likely rely on these being set.
** Icons
Treemacs and Doom themes both rely upon ~all-the-icons~ to look nice
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package all-the-icons)
#+end_src

Along the way nerd-icons also gets installed. On first run or after clearing out elpa/, need to run the following:
: M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts
: M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts

This installs the actual fonts and only needs to be called once. Maybe I'll automate it someday.
** Treemacs
Treemacs provides a file browser on the left hand side of Emacs that I have grown to really like. It's great for exploring unfamiliar projects and modules.

It's installed early because many things have integrations with it, including some themes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package treemacs
    :defer t
    )

  (setq treemacs-no-png-images t)

  (use-package treemacs-evil
    :after (treemacs evil))

  (use-package treemacs-projectile
    :after (treemacs projectile))

  (use-package treemacs-magit
  :after (treemacs magit))
#+end_src
** Theme
I'm mainly using the Doom Emacs theme pack.
I think they're really nice to look at, especially with ~solaire-mode~.
*** Theme packs
**** Doom
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package doom-themes
    :config
    ;; Global settings (defaults)
    (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t    ; if nil, bold is universally disabled
          doom-themes-enable-italic t
          ) ; if nil, italics is universally disabled

    ;; Corrects (and improves) org-mode's native fontification.
    ;; TODO is this still relevant when also using org-modern? or do
    ;; they just conflict?
    (doom-themes-org-config)
    )
#+end_src
**** ef-themes
Protesilaos Stavrou has a nice theme pack too:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ef-themes)
#+end_src
*** Default theme
Prefer to load a theme per-system, but it's nice to have it documented here.
Add a line like the following to the appropriate file in ~local/~
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;  (load-theme 'ef-reverie)
#+end_src
*** Theme lists

#+end_src
**** TODO change the name of choose-theme
the name is too generic and it should be prefixed with something to avoid namespace collisions
** Solaire Mode
Also some visual candy that makes "real" buffers more visible by changing the background color slightly vs e.g. *compilation* or magit buffers
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package solaire-mode)

  ;; treemacs got redefined as a normal window at some point
  (push '(treemacs-window-background-face . solaire-default-face) solaire-mode-remap-alist)
  (push '(treemacs-hl-line-face . solaire-hl-line-face) solaire-mode-remap-alist)

  (solaire-global-mode +1)
#+end_src
** Spacious Padding
More eye candy:
#+begin_quote
It increases the padding or spacing of frames and windows on demand.
The idea with this package is to provide the means to easily toggle between terse and spacious views, depending on the user’s needs.
#+end_quote

Don't know if I'll keep this one but I wanted to try it out
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package spacious-padding
      :hook (after-init . spacious-padding-mode))
#+end_src

** Doom Modeline
The Doom Emacs project also provides a fancy modeline to go along with their themes.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package doom-modeline
    :config       (doom-modeline-def-modeline 'main
                    '(bar matches buffer-info remote-host buffer-position parrot selection-info)

** Configure Recent File Tracking
Emacs comes with ~recentf-mode~ which helps me remember what I was doing after I restart my session.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC
** Install and Configure Projectile
[[https://projectile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][~projectile~]] is a fantastic package that provides all kinds of project context-aware functions for things like:
- running grep, but only inside the project
- compiling the project from the project root without doing anything
- find files within the project, again without having to do anything extra
It's great, it gets installed early, can't live without it. 💘 ~projectile~

#+END_SRC

** Install and Configure Evil Mode
[[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][~evil-mode~]] fundamentally changes Emacs so that while editing all of the modes and keybindings from ~vim~ are present.
It's controversial but I think modal editing is brilliant and have been using ~vim~ bindings for twenty-odd years now. No going back.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Install and Configure Keybindings Helper
[[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][General]] provides more consistent and convenient keybindings, especially with ~evil-mode~.

It's mostly used below in the [[Global Keybindings][global keybindings]] section.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Install and Configure Helm for Command and Control
[[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] is a full-featured command and control package that fundamentally alters a number of core Emacs functions, including what appears when you press ~M-x~ (with the way I have it configured, anyway).
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm
    :delight

** Install and Configure Magit
[[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]] is an incredible integrated ~git~ UI for Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

~git-timeline~ lets you step through the history of a file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  ;; This lets git-timemachine's bindings take precedence over evils'
  ;; (got lucky and happened to find this while looking for the package name, ha!)

#+END_SRC
** Install and Configure ~which-key~
It can be difficult to to remember and discover all of the available shortcuts in Emacs, so [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][~which-key~]] pops up a special buffer to show you available shortcuts whenever you pause in the middle of a keyboard shortcut for more than a few seconds. It's really lovely.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Set up ~pass~ for secrets handling

** Handle "fancy" output in compilation buffer
The external package ~fancy-compilation-mode~ handles colorization and "clever" use of ANSI to create progress bars and stupid shit like that, which show up in things like npm output and Docker output when BuildKit is set to NORMAL. You can, of course, set the BuildKit output style to PLAIN, but sometimes you're eg editing a file where NORMAL is hard-coded in the Makefile target you want to run when using ~compilation-mode~ and fighting project defaults isn't what you want to spend your time on.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (use-package fancy-compilation
    :commands (fancy-compilation-mode))

  (with-eval-after-load 'compile
    (fancy-compilation-mode))
  #+end_src

I don't like how fancy-compilation-mode overrides colors by default, but luckily this can be disabled.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq fancy-compilation-override-colors nil)
#+end_src
** Scream when compilation is finished
Sometimes when the compile process takes more than a few seconds I change windows and get distracted. This hook plays a file through ~aplay~ (something else that will break on a non-Linux machine) to notify me that compilation is done. I was looking for something like a kitchen timer but I couldn't find one so right now the vendored sound is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream][Wilhelm Scream]].

** Configure the Startup Splashscreen
Following Spacemacs's style, I use the [[https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard][~emacs-dashboard~]] project and [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][~all-the-icons~]] to provide an aesthetically pleasing splash screen with useful links to recently used files on launch.

Actually, looking at the project page, the icons don't seem to be working for me. Maybe I need to enable them. I'll investigate later.

Packages with a smaller effect on the experience.
** prism colors by indent level
It takes over the color theme and I don't know if I want it on all the time but it's interesting and I want to have it installed so that I can turn it on in certain situations, like editing highly nested YAML, where it might be invaluable.
If I can remember to use it :)

* Font
The FiraCode font is a programming-focused font with ligatures that looks nice and has a open license so I'm standardizing my editor configuration on that font
** FiraCode Font Installation Script
:properties:
:header-args: :tangle ~/.emacs.d/install-firacode-font.bash :shebang #!/usr/bin/env bash
:end:

Installing fonts is always a pain so I'm going to use a variation of the installation script that the FireCode devs provide under their manual installation guide. This should be Linux-distribution agnostic, even though the font can be installed as a system package with on all of my systems on 2022-02-19 Sat with just

: sudo apt install fonts-firacode

because I don't intend to use Ubuntu as my only system forever. I just happen to be on Ubuntu on 2022-02-19 Sat.

But first, I want to be able to run this script every time Emacs starts, but only have the script actually do anything if the font is not already installed.

This guard will check to see if there's any font with 'fira' in it (case insensitive) and if so, just exits the script. This will happen on most executions.

#+begin_src bash
  set -eo pipefail
  [[ $(fc-list | grep -i fira) != "" ]] && exit 0
#+end_src

Now here's the standard installation script

#+begin_src bash
  fonts_dir="${HOME}/.local/share/fonts"
  if [ ! -d "${fonts_dir}" ]; then
      mkdir -p "${fonts_dir}"
  fi

  version=5.2
  zip=Fira_Code_v${version}.zip
  curl --fail --location --show-error https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases/download/${version}/${zip} --output ${zip}
  unzip -o -q -d ${fonts_dir} ${zip}
  rm ${zip}

  # for now we need the Symbols font, too
  zip=FiraCode-Regular-Symbol.zip
  curl --fail --location --show-error https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/files/412440/${zip} --output ${zip}
  unzip -o -q -d ${fonts_dir} ${zip}
  rm ${zip}

  fc-cache -f
#+end_src

This installation script was sourced from [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Linux-instructions#installing-with-a-package-manager]]

** Enable FiraCode Font

Calling the script from above will install the font
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (shell-command "chmod +x ~/.emacs.d/install-firacode-font.bash")

* Language Configuration
This section contains all of the IDE-like features in my configuration.
** YAML

#+END_SRC
** Rego
[[https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/][whatever that is]]
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package rego-mode)
#+end_src

** Markdown
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package markdown-mode
    :ensure t
    :mode (("README\\.md\\'" . gfm-mode)
           ("\\.md\\'" . gfm-mode)
           ("\\.markdown\\'" . gfm-mode)))

    ;; show code blocks w/ monospace font
    (add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode)
    (add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'variable-pitch-mode)
    (add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook
              '(lambda ()
                 (set-face-attribute 'markdown-code-face nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch)
                 (set-face-attribute 'markdown-pre-face nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch)))

  ;; this can go here because it affects Markdown's live preview mode
  ;; but I should consider putting it somewhere more general maybe?
  (add-hook 'eww-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Docker
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package dockerfile-mode)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("Dockerfile\\'" . dockerfile-mode))
  (put 'dockerfile-image-name 'safe-local-variable #'stringp)
#+END_SRC

** Python
~auto-virtualenv~ looks in ~$WORKON_HOME~ for virtualenvs, and then I can run ~M-x pyvenv-workon RET project RET~ to choose my virtualenv for ~project~, found in ~$WORKON_HOME~, or a symlink anyway.


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package auto-virtualenv)
  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'auto-virtualenv-set-virtualenv)
  (setenv "WORKON_HOME" "~/.virtualenvs")
#+END_SRC

So the convention for use is:

1) Create a virtualenv as usual for the project
2) Symlink it inside ~/.virtualenvs
3) ~M-x pyvenv-workon~

** Go
Go is my primary language so it's my most dynamic and complicated configuration, however it degrades gracefully so if not everything is installed, the rest of it still works.
*** Dependencies
Go support requires some dependencies. I will try to list them all here.
Stuff I have installed has some overlap because of the in-progress move to LSP, but I'll prune it later.

- First, ~go~ itself must be installed, install however, and available on the ~PATH~.

- ~gopls~, the language server for LSP mentioned above [[https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/user.md]]. I have been just running this off of ~master~ so I can experience all the latest +bugs+ features, so clone the gopls project (TODO find the url for it and put a link here) and ~go install~ it. After you're done ~gopls~ should also be on the ~PATH~.
  [[https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/emacs.md#gopls-configuration][Directions for configuring ~gopls~ through this file are found here.]]

- ~golint~ has to be installed independently

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ go get https://github.com/golang/lint
#+END_SRC

- [[https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint][~golangci-lint~]] is a meta linter that calls a bunch of 3rd party linters (configurable) and replaces the old one that used to freeze my computer. ~go-metalinter~, I think, is what it was called. Anyway, it used to crash my computer and /apparently/ that was a common experience. Anyway ~golangci-lint~ must be installed independently, too:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# install it into ./bin/
$ curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s v1.23.6
#+END_SRC

*** Initial Setup
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package go-mode
    :hook ((go-mode . yas-minor-mode)
           (go-mode . eglot-ensure))
    :config
    ;; fixes ctrl-o after goto-definition by telling evil that godef-jump jumps
    (evil-add-command-properties #'godef-jump :jump t))


  ;; enable golangci-lint to work with flycheck
  (use-package flycheck-golangci-lint
    :hook (go-mode . flycheck-golangci-lint-setup))
    #+END_SRC
    
*** Eglot Config
Since Go has auto formatting and imports management as a first-party feature I like to enable that as an automatic step before save in Emacs so that I do not have to remember to remove unwantetd imports, or to add new ones, or to format my code, literally ever. I am totally pampered by this state of affairs and Go is my bae for having all of these features.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues/574#issuecomment-1401023985
  (defun my-eglot-organize-imports () (interactive)
         (eglot-code-actions nil nil "source.organizeImports" t))

  (defun install-my-eglot-organize-imports () 
    (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'my-eglot-organize-imports nil t)
    (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'eglot-format-buffer nil t))

  (add-hook 'go-mode-hook #'install-my-eglot-organize-imports)
#+end_src

The Go Emacs docs suggest using this snippet which I think might help with some freezing I've been seeing when stepping into previously unseen library code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  (defun project-find-go-module (dir)
    (when-let ((root (locate-dominating-file dir "go.mod")))
      (cons 'go-module root)))

  (cl-defmethod project-root ((project (head go-module)))
    (cdr project))

  (add-hook 'project-find-functions #'project-find-go-module)
#+end_src

Preliminary testing suggests it might do the trick

*** Package and Configuration for Executing Tests
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  (advice-add 'go-test-current-test :before #'projectile-save-project-buffers)
  (add-hook 'go-test-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** REPL
[[https://github.com/motemen/gore][Gore]] provides a REPL and [[https://github.com/manute/gorepl-mode][gorepl-mode]] lets you use it from Emacs. In order to use the REPL from Emacs, you must first install Gore:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go get -u github.com/motemen/gore/cmd/gore
#+END_SRC
Gore also uses gocode for code completion, so install that (even though Emacs uses go-pls for the same).
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go get -u github.com/mdempsky/gocode
#+END_SRC

Once that's done ~gorepl-mode~ is ready to be installed:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package gorepl-mode)
#+END_SRC

1. Install ~rustup~.
2. Run ~rustup component add rls rust-analysis rust-src~.

** Web
After some amount of searching and fumbling about I have discovered [[http://web-mode.org/][~web-mode~]] which appears to be the one-stop-shop solution for all of your HTML and browser-related needs. It handles a whole slew of web-related languages and templating formats and plays nicely with LSP. It's also the only package that I could find that supported ~.tsx~ files at all.

So yay for ~web-mode~!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

*** Setting highlighting for special template modes
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; web-mode can provide syntax highlighting for many template
  ;; engines, but it can't detect the right one if the template uses a generic ending.
  ;; If a project uses a generic ending for its templates, such
  ;; as .html, add it below. It would be more elegant to handle this by
  ;; setting this variable in .dir-locals.el for each project,
  ;; unfortunately due to this https://github.com/fxbois//issues/799 that
  ;; is not possible :(

  ;;(setq web-mode-engines-alist '(

I don't have any custom configuration for Emacs Lisp yet, but I am going to use this space to collect tools and resources that might become useful in the future, and which I may install.

** Racket
Funny the twists of fate that bring us back to where we started. My interest in Emacs stemmed originally from an interest in Racket, and my inability to get vim to format Racket code appropriately.
I never did wind up learning Racket, but I guess I might now, for entirely different reasons

* Adaptive Wrap and Visual Line Mode
Here I've done some black magic fuckery for a few modes. Heathens in modern languages and also some other prose modes don't wrap their long lines at 80 characters like God intended so instead of using visual-column-mode which I think does something similar but probably would've been easier, I've defined an abomination of a combination of ~visual-line-mode~ (built-in) and [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/adaptive-wrap.html][adaptive-wrap-prefix-mode]] to **dynamically (visually) wrap and indent long lines in languages like Go with no line length limit** so they look nice on my screen at any window width and don't change the underlying file — and it's actually pretty cool.

** Using eglot with Org
~eglot~  and  Babel  seems to  still  be  a  work  in progress  as  of <2024-11-16 Sat>.

The code snippet  below, from [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues/523#issuecomment-1746342643][this comment]]  on the thread about  adding support for Org  Babel, seems like it  could be a temporary  solution as  support  seems to  be slow  in  coming, but  I haven't tried it out yet.

I'm storing it here  as an ~example~  for when I'm  ready -- I  happened upon this while searching for something else and don't want to lose it, but I'm not ready for it right this moment either.
#+begin_example emacs-lisp

** Opening the Remote Repo in the Browser from Emacs
[[https://github.com/rmuslimov/browse-at-remote]]
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package browse-at-remote)
#+end_src

** Opening Sources in Emacs from the Browser
https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html

First use this ~.desktop~ file to register a handler for the new protocol scheme:
#+begin_src desktop :tangle ~/.local/share/applications/org-protocol.desktop
  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=org-protocol
  Comment=Intercept calls from emacsclient to trigger custom actions
  Categories=Other;
  Keywords=org-protocol;
  Icon=emacs
  Type=Application
  Exec=org-protocol %u
  #Exec=emacsclient -- %u
  Terminal=false
  StartupWMClass=Emacs
  MimeType=x-scheme-handler/org-protocol;
#+end_src

After tangling that file to its destination, run the following command to update the database:
: update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/

Add the custom ~org-protocol~ script to intercept calls from the browser, do any necessary pre-processing, and hand off the corrected input to ~emacsclient~:

#+begin_src bash :tangle ~/bin/org-protocol :shebang #!/usr/bin/env bash :tangle-mode (identity #o755)
  # for some reason the bookmarklet strips a colon, so use sed to remove
  # the botched prefix and rebuild it correctly
  emacsclient -- org-protocol://open-source://$(echo "$@" | sed 's#org-protocol://open-source//##g') | tee /tmp/xdg-emacsclient
  # that's probably a useless call to echo but whatever
#+end_src

For now this is extremely rudimentary and I will improve it as needed.

*** Manual Steps:
1. The first time, add a button in the browser by creating a bookmarklet containing the following target:
#+begin_example
Source Code
;; Defined in /usr/local/share/emacs/29.1/lisp/org/org-protocol.el.gz
(defun org-protocol-open-source (fname)
  "Process an org-protocol://open-source?url= style URL with FNAME.

Change a filename by mapping URLs to local filenames as set
in `org-protocol-project-alist'.

The location for a browser's bookmark should look like this:

  javascript:location.href = \\='org-protocol://open-source?\\=' +
        new URLSearchParams({url: location.href})
#+end_example

2. Add an entry to ~org-protocol-project-alist~, defined in the local machine's hostname-specific config found in ~local/~. An example can be found on the Worg page above, but here it is again for easy reference:
   
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq org-protocol-project-alist
      '(("Worg"
         :base-url "https://orgmode.org/worg/"
         :working-directory "/home/user/worg/"
         :online-suffix ".html"
         :working-suffix ".org")
        ("My local Org-notes"
         :base-url "http://localhost/org/"
         :working-directory "/home/user/org/"
         :online-suffix ".php"
         :working-suffix ".org")))
#+end_src

N.B. this code block does **not** get tangled into ~init.el~.

**** TODO automate the cloning of unknown repos and addition to this list
I want to be able to press the button on new repos that I haven't cloned yet, and have them dumped to a sane location and then added to the list and opened.

**** TODO test a new bookmarklet with the quoted syntax from the Org-Protocol docs
also, I stumbled on this in the docs and it looks interesting and relevant:
#+begin_example
;;   5.) Optionally add custom sub-protocols and handlers:
;;
;;       (setq org-protocol-protocol-alist
;;             '(("my-protocol"
;;                :protocol "my-protocol"
;;                :function my-protocol-handler-function)))
;;
;;       A "sub-protocol" will be found in URLs like this:
;;
;;           org-protocol://sub-protocol://data
;;
;; If it works, you can now setup other applications for using this feature.

** Customize the frame (OS window) title
Taken from StackOverflow, at least for now, which does 90% of what I want and can serve as a future reference of how to customize this aspect of Emacs.

** Tweak align-regexp
Configure align-regexp to use spaces instead of tabs. This is mostly for this file. When my keybindings are in two columns and ~M-x align-regexp~ uses tabs, the columns look aligned in Emacs but unaligned on GitHub. Using spaces faces this. This snippet effects that change.

* Hostname-based tweaks

This is a simple convention that I use for loading machine-specific configuration for the different machines I run Emacs on.

1. looks for Org files in  ~/home/$USER/.emacs.d/local/~ with a name that is the same as the hostname of the machine.
2. shells out to call ~hostname~ to determine the hostname.
3. tangles that .org file to a .el file and executes it

This allows configuration to diverge to meet needs that are unique to a specific workstation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (let ;; find the hostname and assign it to a variable
       ((hostname (string-trim-right
                   (shell-command-to-string "hostname"))))

     (progn
       (org-babel-tangle-file
        (concat "~/.emacs.d/local/" hostname ".org")
        (concat hostname ".el"))

There must be an Org file in ~local/~ named ~$(hostname).org~ or init actually breaks. 
This isn't great but for now I've just been making a copy of one of the existing files whenever I start on a new machine.
It may someday feel worth my time to automate this, but so far it hasn't been worth it, and I just create ~local/"$(hostname).org"~ as part of initial setup, along with other tasks that I do not automate in this file.

* Launching Emacsclient
[[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsClient#h5o-18][Nifty shell function for hassle-free starting of emacsclient]]
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle ~/bin/ec :shebang #!/usr/bin/bash
  args=""
  nw=false
  # check if emacsclient is already running
  if pgrep -U $(id -u) emacsclient > /dev/null; then running=true; fi

  # check if the user wants TUI mode
  for arg in "$@"; do
      if [ "$arg" = "-nw" ] || [ "$arg" = "-t" ] || [ "$arg" = "--tty" ]
      then
          nw=true
      fi
  done

  # if called without arguments - open a new gui instance
  if [ "$#" -eq "0" ] || [ "$running" != true ]; then
      args=(-c $args)           # open emacsclient in a new window
  fi
  if [ "$#" -gt "0" ]; then
      # if 'em -' open standard input (e.g. pipe)
      if [[ "$1" == "-" ]]; then

* Running Emacs properly from the GUI

This ~.desktop~ file calls ~emacs~ when it's not already running, and ~emacsclient~ otherwise.
Slow on first launch, then fast for every new frame thereafter.

Tangling this file will install the .desktop file to the correct location (~~/.local/share/applications/Emacsclient.desktop~).

#+begin_src toml :tangle ~/.local/share/applications/Emacsclient.desktop

** TODO Figure out how to run Emacs as a daemon so that closing the last frame doesn't exit 
Launching in headless mode introduces some font problems (fonts don't load when changing themes) that I haven't been able to debug. 

* Compiling Emacs from Source
Some notes on the dependencies that I found were needed to build Emacs 29.1 on fresh Ubuntu with the configuration flags that I like 
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./autogen.sh
sudo apt-get install make autoconf libx11-dev libmagickwand-dev libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libgccjit-11-dev libxpm-dev libgif-dev libgnutls28-dev libjansson-dev libncurses-dev texinfo libtree-sitter-dev
./configure --with-imagemagick --with-xwidgets --with-json --with-x-toolkit=gtk3 --with-native-compilation --with-mailutils --with-x --with-tree-sitter --without-toolkit-scroll-bars
