# Ian's Emacs Configs

This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration.

The documentation is written in a syntax which allows me to interleave a narrative with the source code. I hope for it to be as interesting to read as it is useful to execute. It is useful to me in any case.

[You can read the story of my Emacs environment alongside its ever-changing implementation in its native executable format here](https://github.com/gigawhitlocks/emacs-configs/blob/master/ian.org).

And all of its history is stored in this repository, as well.

That's pretty neat.
