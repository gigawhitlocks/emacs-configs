* What is this?
This is my Emacs configuration file, which I install at ~~/.emacs.d/ian.org~. It's written in Org mode syntax, which exports to a number of other formats, including HTML and Markdown, and allows extraction of source code blocks into plain source code files through a process called "tangling," so the source code embedded below is ultimately run as my real programming environment.

I have chosen to write a fully custom Emacs environment, eschewing projects like Spacemacs and Doom Emacs for my own custom configuration because I find Emacs Lisp a joy to write -- combined with its native environment, Emacs, Emacs Lisp is an incredibly powerful addition to my workflow, and writing my own config has helped me master both the editor and the language it is largely written in, and with which it is customized.

If you're reading this on the web, the source code for this file can be found [[https://github.com/gigawhitlocks/emacs-configs/blob/master/ian.org][on Github]].
If you want to try out this configuration file, run the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  #!/bin/bash
  git clone https://github.com/gigawhitlocks/emacs-configs ~/.emacs.d
  mv ~/.emacs.d/local/wintermute.org ~/.emacs.d/local/"$(hostname)".org
  emacs
#+END_SRC

No guarantees, though. This stuff is for personal use, so it isn't tested on systems I don't have! Hopefully this file is readable enough that individual snippets are understandable and can be taken /a la cart√©/.

Here is a screenshot of this file being edited with this configuration:

* Entrypoint
:properties:
:header-args: :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el :comments link
:end:

Using Org for one's configuration is not standard Emacs behavior, so I must first configure Emacs to load this file (~ian.org~) as its first action when it starts up. By default, Emacs runs ~init.el~ at the beginning of execution. The following piece of code [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-source-code.html][tangles]] to ~init.el~, and ~init.el~ containing the following must be checked in, because this snippet tangles /this/ file (~ian.org~), so **it is this piece of code that starts the whole process of loading all of this configuration**.

Since I want most of the configuration here in ~ian.org~, ~init.el~ just holds the bare minimum code so that the bulk of the configuration can be checked in once, inside this file, rather than twice like the contents of ~init.el~. I'm using an [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-emacs-init][example from orgmode.org]] to load the Org files and tangle them, then ~require~ the output of this file from the call to tangle, run ~main~, and I'm done.

**NOTE** The filename ~ian.org~ is hardcoded in this entrypoint routine in the place of the main configuration file. This is because, despite the public nature of my config, it is not intended to be used in whole by anyone but me. This allows me certain shortcuts, like hostname-specific configuration, and convention-over-configuration in ways I find intuitive without overly detailed documentation. It is _my_ config, after all, so my main config file is ~ian.org~.

The rest of the code that is executed begins with the routines defined by this file.

* My Environment
:properties:
:header-args: :tangle yes :comments link :noweb yes
:end:

The point of Emacs, and the reason every Emacs user should write his or her own configuration, is to build your own environment so that it behaves how you want it to.

This may seem to be a lot of work, and it is. But if a serious guitar player might have a custom guitar built, I see no reason I shouldn't use a custom environment for my craft.

*This is where my environment definition begins*

After running the ~init.el~ entrypoint, this file is tangled to ~ian.el~ and executed. Right now all configuration other than the entrypoint is in this file.

** Bootstrap
The first thing that must be done is to prepare to manage third party packages, because my config is built on top of the work of many third party packages. I like to install and manage all of the packages I use as part of my configuration so that it can be duplicated across computers (more or less) and managed with ~git~, so I use ~use-package~ to ensure that packages are installed from my configuration file.

Bootstrap sets up the ELPA, Melpa, and Org Mode repositories, sets up the package manager, installs [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][~use-package~]] if it is not found, configures ~use-package~ and installs a few extra packages that acoutrement ~use-package~ and will be used heavily throughout.

#+END_SRC

Once this is done I need to install and configure any third party packages that are used in many modes throughout Emacs. Some of these modes fundamentally change the Emacs experience and need to be present before everything can be configured.

** Package Installation and Configuration
First I need to install packages with a large effect and which other packages are likely to depend. These are packages essential to my workflow. Configuration here should be config that must run early, before variables are set or language-related packages, which will likely rely on these being set.

*** Install and Configure Treemacs
Treemacs provides a neotree-like file tree on the left hand side of Emacs. I bind it to a global key to make it pop up, and add frequent projects to it manually on each machine. It has become essential to my workflow, especially for flipping between projects. LSP is aware of it, too, which adds some really cool features likes function lists inside. Just wish I could adjust the width.

*** Theme
Going to try out the Doom themepack because why not.

N.B. Must run ~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts~ once & restart Emacs to get icons to work in Treemacs
TODO automate this step, too

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

[[https://projectile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][~projectile~]] is a fantastic package that provides all kinds of project context-aware functions for things like:
- running grep, but only inside the project
- compiling the project from the project root without doing anything
- find files within the project, again without having to do anything extra
It's great, it gets installed early, can't live without it. üíò ~projectile~

*** Install and Configure Evil Mode
[[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][~evil-mode~]] fundamentally changes Emacs so that while editing all of the modes and keybindings from ~vim~ are present.
It's controversial but I think modal editing is brilliant and have been using ~vim~ bindings since the mid-aughts. No going back.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

*** Install and Configure Keybindings Helper

*** Install and Configure Helm for Command and Control

[[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] is a full-featured command and control package that fundamentally alters a number of core Emacs functions, including what appears when you press ~M-x~ (with the way I have it configured, anyway).

*** Install and Configure Magit
[[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]] is an incredible integrated ~git~ UI for Emacs.

    (use-package magit)
    ;; disable the default emacs vc because git is all I use,
    ;; for I am a simple man
    (setq vc-handled-backends nil)
#+END_SRC

The Magit author publishes an additional package called [[https://emacsair.me/2018/12/19/forge-0.1/][forge]]. Forge lets you interact with Github and Gitlab from inside of Emacs. There's planned support for Gogs, Gitea, etc.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package forge
      :after magit)
#+END_SRC

Forge has to be configured with something like ~.authinfo~ or preferably ~authinfo.gpg~. Create a access token through the web UI of Github and place on the first line in ~$HOME/.authinfo~ with the following format:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
host api.github.com login gigawhitlocks^forge password TOKEN
#+END_SRC

but obviously replace ~TOKEN~ with the access token. And [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/keeping-secrets-in-emacs-gnupg-auth-sources][use ~.authinfo.gpg~ and encrypt it]]. Don't just use ~.authinfo~.

Also, I've only tried this with GitHub. But at least in the case of GitHub, once Forge is set up, it adds some niceties like this to the Magit overview. In this case, I'm looking at the history of a project and Forge automatically adds a link to the PR displayed as part of the commit title in history:

*** Install and Configure ~which-key~
It can be difficult to to remember and discover all of the available shortcuts in Emacs, so [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][~which-key~]] pops up a special buffer to show you available shortcuts whenever you pause in the middle of a keyboard shortcut for more than a few seconds. It's really lovely.

*** Scream when compilation is finished
Sometimes when the compile process takes more than a few seconds I change windows and get distracted.

Go support requires some dependencies. I will try to list them all here.
Stuff I have installed has some overlap because of the in-progress move to LSP, but I'll prune it later.

- First, ~go~ itself must be installed, install however, and avalailable on the ~PATH~.

- ~gopls~, the language server for LSP mentioned above [[https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/user.md]]. I have been just running this off of ~master~ so I can experience all the latest +bugs+ features, so clone the gopls project (TODO find the url for it and put a link here) and ~go install~ it. After you're done ~gopls~ should also be on the ~PATH~.
  [[https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/emacs.md#gopls-configuration][Directions for configuring ~gopls~ through this file are found here.]] 

- ~golint~ has to be installed independently

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ go get https://github.com/golang/lint
#+END_SRC

Nothing to do with Emacs, but ~eg~ also looks really cool:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/eg
#+END_SRC

- [[https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint][~golangci-lint~]] is a meta linter that calls a bunch of 3rd party linters (configurable) and replaces the old one that used to freeze my computer. ~go-metalinter~, I think, is what it was called. Anyway, it used to crash my computer and /apparently/ that was a common experience. Anyway ~golangci-lint~ must be installed independently, too:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# install it into ./bin/
$ curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s v1.23.6

#+END_SRC

**** Initial Setup

**** REPL
[[https://github.com/motemen/gore][Gore]] provides a REPL and [[https://github.com/manute/gorepl-mode][gorepl-mode]] lets you use it from Emacs. In order to use the REPL from Emacs, you must first install Gore:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go get -u github.com/motemen/gore/cmd/gore
#+END_SRC
Gore also uses gocode for code completion, so install that (even though Emacs uses go-pls for the same).
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go get -u github.com/mdempsky/gocode
#+END_SRC

Once that's done ~gorepl-mode~ is ready to be installed:

*** Web

After some amount of searching and fumbling about I have discovered [[http://web-mode.org/][~web-mode~]] which appears to be the one-stop-shop solution for all of your HTML and browser-related needs. It handles a whole slew of web-related languages and templating formats and plays nicely with LSP. It's also the only package that I could find that supported ~.tsx~ files at all.

So yay for ~web-mode~!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

*** Shell
Shell mode is pretty good vanilla, but I prefer to use spaces rather than tabs for indents with languages like Bash because they just tend to format more reliably. Tabs are .. theoretically more flexible, so maybe I can come back to consider this.
But for now, disable ~indent-tabs-mode~ in shell script editing mode because I have been observing behavior from ~whitespace-cleanup-mode~ that when ~indent-tabs-mode~ is ~t~ it will change 4 spaces to a tab even if there are other spaces being used for indent, even on the same line, and regardless as to the never-ending debate about spaces and tabs and all that, everyone can agree that 1) mixing spaces and tabs is terrible and 2) your editor shouldn't be mixing spaces and tabs automatically at pre-save time.

*** Adaptive Wrap and Visual Line Mode
Here I've done some black magic fuckery for a few modes. Heathens in modern languages and also some other prose modes don't wrap their long lines at 80 characters like God intended so instead of using visual-column-mode which I think does something similar but probably would've been easier, I've defined an abomination of a combination of ~visual-line-mode~ (built-in) and [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/adaptive-wrap.html][adaptive-wrap-prefix-mode]] to **dynamically (visually) wrap and indent long lines in languages like Go with no line length limit** so they look nice on my screen at any window width and don't change the underlying file ‚Äî and it's actually pretty cool.

*** Customize the frame (OS window) title
Taken from StackOverflow, at least for now, which does 90% of what I want and can serve as a future reference of how to customize this aspect of Emacs. This displays the file name and major mode in the OS title bar. Will have to find the documentation that defines the format string passed to ~frame-title-format~ at some point.

*** Tweak align-regexp
Configure align-regexp to use spaces instead of tabs. This is mostly for this file. When my keybindings are in two columns and ~M-x align-regexp~ uses tabs, the columns look aligned in Emacs but unaligned on GitHub. Using spaces faces this. This snippet effects that change.

** ERC (IRC config)
I don't like to check in my IRC nicks into this file, so I've utilized ~/home/$USER/.authinfo~ which is apparently a GNU standard. The format for this file follows this pattern:

~machine HOSTNAME login USER password PASSWORD port PORTNUMBER~

So we can use ~sed~ and ~grep~ which are available on all of my machines to look up the nick, and then once we have the nick, Emacs will get the rest automatically. Then I manage ~.authinfo~ manually on each machine.

I wrote a quick Bash one-liner to extract the login. Maybe I could've done this in elisp but Emacs makes it easy enough to mix languages, so here is the one-liner, which will tangle out to ~get-nick.bash~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle ~/.emacs.d/get-nick.bash :shebang /bin/bash
grep "$1" ~/.authinfo | sed 's/.*login \([^ ]\+ \).*/\1/g'
#+END_SRC

Then configure Emacs to use this to find the nick (and put in place the rest of the configuration that I would like for ERC):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun irc ()
    "Connect to IRC."
    (interactive)

    ;; tangle this file to produce the bash script
    (org-babel-tangle "~/.emacs.d/ian.org")

    ;; some visual tweaks

    (let ((

                          "~/.emacs.d/get-nick.bash freenode"))
           ))

      (erc-tls
       ;; these days I only use Freenode

** Hostname-based tweaks
Looks for Org files in  ~/home/$USER/.emacs.d/local/~ with a name that is the same as the hostname of the machine.
I don't know what this does if you try to run Emacs in Windows because I don't do that, but on Mac and Linux it shells out to call ~hostname~ to determine the hostname.
Then Emacs tangles that .org file to a .el file and executes it, allowing configuration to diverge to meet needs that are unique to a specific workstation.

Right now I have three configurations:
- [[./local/relay.org][my server]]
- [[./local/rocinante.org][my work machine]]
- [[./local/wintermute.org][my laptop]]
- [[./local/terminus.org][my... desktop?]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; simplifies setting a font and changing it immediately
  (defun set-font (font)
    (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font font )
    (set-frame-font font nil t))

  (let ;; find the hostname and assign it to a variable
       ((hostname (string-trim-right

     (progn
       (org-babel-tangle-file

        (concat hostname ".el"))

       (load (concat "~/.emacs.d/local/" hostname ".el"))
       (require 'local)))
#+END_SRC

There must be an Org file in ~local/~ named ~$(hostname).org~ or init actually breaks. This isn't great but for now I've just been making a copy of one of the existing files whenever I start on a new machine.
